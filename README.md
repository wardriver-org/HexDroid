HexDroid is a free and open source IRC client for Android. It provides a clean, modern interface while supporting the features users expect from a desktop client — including IRCv3 capabilities, SASL authentication, TLS encryption, bouncer support, DCC file transfers, end-to-end encrypted chat, TOR, scripting support and an array of commands.

> **Requirements:** Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher &nbsp;·&nbsp; **License:** GPLv3

</table>

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boxlabss/hexdroid.git
cd hexdroid
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
---

## Quick Start

1. Tap **Networks** and the **+ button** to enter a server hostname and port (`6697` for TLS)
2. Set your nickname; optionally configure SASL credentials
3. Save and tap **Connect**
4. Use `/join #channel` or tap **Channel list** to browse

**To encrypt a conversation:** open the channel or DM, tap the overflow menu (⋮) **Secure Chat**, generate a key, and share it with your contact. Import the same key on their device and confirm the safety numbers match. See the [encryption guide](https://hexdroid.org/encryption) for step-by-step instructions.

---

## Privacy

No ads, analytics, crash reporters, or third-party SDKs. The app communicates only with the IRC servers you configure. All data is stored locally and deleted with the app. End-to-end encryption keys never leave the device. See the full [privacy policy](https://hexdroid.org/privacy).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue before submitting a PR for non-trivial changes.

**Bug reports should include:**

- Device model and Android version
- HexDroid version (Settings → About)
- Steps to reproduce
- Relevant logcat output (Android Studio > Logcat, filter by `hexdroid`)

**Developers:**

Plugins for E2E +AGM encryption are available for some desktop and a terminal client in `/aes-client-plugins`
The docs for both +AGM and +AGE are in `/docs` and client authors wanting to interoperate with HexDroid's encryption should start there.

Translations are managed in the string resources under `app/src/main/res/values-*/`. If your language is missing or incomplete, a PR updating the relevant `strings.xml` is very welcome.

## Reproducible Builds

The Play Store and IzzyOnDroid releases are [reproducibly buildable](https://reproducible-builds.org/). The `RB Status` badge above links to the verification record.

To verify locally:

```bash
# 1. Build from a clean checkout. No KEYSTORE_* variables set.
./gradlew clean assembleRelease
#    -> app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk

# 2. Fetch the published APK you want to check against.
curl -LO https://hexdroid.org/releases/hexdroid-latest.apk

# 3. Compare. apksigcopier's "compare" does this properly: it copies the signature across and diffs everything else.
pip install apksigcopier
apksigcopier compare hexdroid-latest.apk --unsigned \
    app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

A clean run prints nothing and exits 0. For a byte-level look at any difference, `diffoscope` over the two APKs is the usual next step.

Building a signed release requires all four of `KEYSTORE_FILE`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `KEY_PASSWORD`. Setting only some of them fails the build. Automated or scripted release builds should pass `-PrequireSigning=true`, which fails the build if nothing will sign the output, so a misconfigured runner cannot quietly produce an unsigned APK.

### Wardriver fork additions

File and image uploads are **disabled by default**. Enable them under
**Settings → Media → File uploader**. drop.fo is preselected for the first opt-in;
your selected provider is preserved when toggling uploads off and back on.

Choose drop.fo, 0x0.st, Catbox, Litterbox (24-hour retention), a self-hosted
rustypaste instance, or a custom multipart endpoint. Custom uploaders support a
configurable file field and response URLs in plain text, a Location header, or a
JSON key (including nested paths such as `data.url`). rustypaste and custom
endpoints support an optional Authorization header stored encrypted, scoped to
the exact endpoint, and excluded from settings exports. HTTPS is required unless
you explicitly allow HTTP for your own server.

Uploaded links are added to the draft for review before sending. Files follow the
selected service's retention rules. IRC credentials are never sent; uploads are
blocked on proxied networks and when the per-network upload switch is off. A
temporary copy in the app's private cache supplies the exact request size and is
deleted after the attempt. A failed upload never falls back to a different host.

Settings → Appearance → Theme includes **Dracula** and all four Catppuccin flavours:
**Latte**, **Frappé**, **Macchiato**, and **Mocha**. Latte is light; the others are dark.

Remote chat images, animated GIFs, Twitter/X metadata and thumbnails,
and chat avatars follow the selected network's SOCKS5 or SOCKS4a
settings. Configure the proxy in the network editor; SOCKS5 username/password
authentication is supported. Destination hostnames resolve at the proxy, and a
failed or invalid proxy never falls back to a direct connection. Preview opt-in,
Wi-Fi restrictions, HTTPS checks, and image size limits still apply. Twitter/X embedded video stays disabled on proxied profiles. YouTube thumbnails
and embedded playback use a direct connection, including on proxied networks. Network icons remain hidden for proxied profiles.

The default server list includes **Wardriver IRC**, `ircs://irc.wardriver.org:6697`,
with TLS enabled and normal certificate validation. Existing saved profiles are
preserved; the preset is also added once on upgrade, without duplicating an
existing Wardriver profile or restoring it after you delete it.

The attachment menu offers photo/video capture, photo/document selection, text
snippets, and recent upload links. Paste a copied image or file with **Paste file
or image** in the chatbox context menu or attachment menu, or **Ctrl+V** / **Shift+Insert**
on a hardware keyboard. Plain-text paste keeps its usual behaviour. Multiple
attachments upload in sequence to the selected provider and add links to the original chat's
draft. Nothing is sent to IRC until you press Send. Upload history stays on-device
and includes expiring links rather than permanent copies of the files.

### Image privacy and age-encrypted uploads

Every image passes through metadata removal before any upload, including files
whose actual image type differs from the advertised MIME type. Supported images
are decoded, oriented, and re-encoded as PNG without source EXIF, GPS, camera,
XMP, or IPTC metadata. Animated images become a still frame. Unsupported images
or images over 32 megapixels are rejected rather than uploaded unchanged.

Enable **Encrypt uploads with age** in the uploader settings and paste one or
more native `age1…` public recipient keys, one per line. Include your own public
key if you also need to decrypt. The official Go age library encrypts the cleaned
image or document locally before upload; the host receives `attachment.age` and
no private keys. This file encryption is separate from HexDroid's IRC +AGE chat
protocol. Each configured recipient can decrypt the same file independently.

The recipient creates a private identity and shares only its public recipient:

```sh
age-keygen -o key.txt
age-keygen -y key.txt
```

Download the shared URL as `attachment.age`, then decrypt an uploaded image:

```sh
age -d -i key.txt -o image.png attachment.age
```

For a document, choose its original filename instead of `image.png`. Keep
`key.txt` private. Losing all recipient private keys makes the upload unreadable.
Recipients on Android can use an age-compatible decryptor or the age CLI in
Termux. Encrypted files cannot display as ordinary inline image previews.

Native builds require Go 1.26 and Android NDK 27.2.12479018. Run
`scripts/build-age-android.sh` to generate the local agebridge AAR; Android CI
runs this step and the official-age round-trip test before building the APK.
The Gradle pre-build step also generates the AAR when it is missing.
